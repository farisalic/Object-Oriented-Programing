# Assignment 1 - content

## zad1
Enter certain amount of numbers through standard input into vector until EOF is reached or we get a invalid entry (something other than a number). Print all members of the vector, then sort from smallest to largest and add all members of the vector.

## zad2
Write a program that allows input of one word and then sorts characters based on whether they're uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers...

## zad3
The *framed name* task: Entered name is printed as framed regardless of its length.

## zad4
The program asks the user to enter the number of sentences that we'd like to enter. After that we enter the sentences we were looking for and calculate the average length of them.

## zad5
Write a program that asks for the input of a sequence of numbers. Input continues until the EOF signal. After that, the program prints all the numbers and the sum of the odd ones.

## zad6
Write a program that allows input of *n* amount of numbers, after which program sorts the vector, prints the arithmetic mean of the vector. The vector should be sorted and printed.

## zad7
Enter a vector of strings, sort it and print it framed in a way similiar to **zad3** but on a slightly bigger scale.

## zad8
Write a program that allows the user to enter a line of text and then converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa, but without using the *algorithm* header.

## zad9
Write a program that receives a vector of strings and then sends them to a function that checks whether there is a punctuation mark at the end of the sentence and, if there is none, adds it to the end of each string.

## zad10
Write a program that will enable the sorting of vectors in such a way that all even elements are at the beginning and odd elements are at the end of the vector.
