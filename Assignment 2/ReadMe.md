# Assignment 2 - contents

## zad1
Write a *find_if* function that receives 2 iterators and a predicate function that defines the condition by which we search the elements of the container. The function returns an iterator to the element that was found, otherwise it returns an end iterator.

## zad2
Implement the *all_of* algorithm that receives 2 iterators and a predicate function that checks whether all elements in the container meet the criteria defined by the predicate function and returns true if they do, and returns false if at least one element does not meet the condition of the function.

## zad3
Write a *copy_if* function that receives two iterators (begin and end), a vector into which we will copy the elements, as well as a predicate function that defines which members of the container are copied.

## zad4
Write a *distance function* that calculates the distance between two passed iterators.

## zad5
Write a *count_if* function that receives two iterators and a predicate function. The function returns the number of elements that satisfy the condition defined by the predicate function.Å½

## zad6
Write a *any_of* function that takes two iterators and a predicate function. The function returns an iterator to the first element that satisfies the condition, otherwise if no elements meet the criteria of the predicate function it returns an end iterator.

## zad7
Write a function *none_of* that receives two iterators and the predicate function. The function returns true if no element satisfies the condition. Otherwise it returns false.

## zad8
Write a function *adjacent_find* that receives two iterators and a predicate function. The function returns two successive iterators that satisfy the condition of the predicate function.

## zad9
Write a function that receives two iterators, the number *n* that represents the number of elements that we copy, as well as an iterator that allows adding new elements to the end of the new container.

## zad10
Write a *copy_backward* function that receives two iterators and a destination iterator that enables copying elements to a new destination vector. Elements are copied from the end to the beginning.
